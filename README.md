# News-Source-Analysis-using-Modeling-and-Classification-of-Tweets

# Introduction
  * In recent times, social media is one of the major ways by which people access news and information.
  * However, information that passes through tweets is not verifiable during real time. Thus, there is a lot of scope for spreading of misinformation and bogus news.
  * This project will analyse tweets for their credibility so that content can be both accessible and correct at the same time.
  * Categorize the content of tweets into :
    * Very high credibility
    * High Credibility
    * Neutral Credibility
    * Low Credibility
    * Very Low Credibility
  * Perform two tasks: User Classification and Tweet Classification to determine Content Credibility:
   
    * User | H | H | H | N | N | N | L | L | L 
      --- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |---
      Tweet | H | N | L | H | N | L | H | N | L 
      Content | VH | H | N | H | N | L | N | L | VL
