# News-Source-Analysis-using-Modeling-and-Classification-of-Tweets

# Introduction
  * In recent times, social media is one of the major ways by which people access news and information.
  * However, information that passes through tweets is not verifiable during real time. Thus, there is a lot of scope for spreading of misinformation and bogus news.
  * This project will analyse tweets for their credibility so that content can be both accessible and correct at the same time.
  * Categorize the content of tweets into :
    * Very high credibility
    * High Credibility
    * Neutral Credibility
    * Low Credibility
    * Very Low Credibility
  * Perform two tasks: User Classification and Tweet Classification to determine Content Credibility:
   
    * User | H | H | H | N | N | N | L | L | L 
      --- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |---
      Tweet | H | N | L | H | N | L | H | N | L 
      Content | VH | H | N | H | N | L | N | L | VL
 * Sample of Data and Preprocessing steps:

* **User Parameters:**

Based on our literature survey, we chose the following parameters for determining user credibility:
  
    1. Source: The source from where the tweet was published
    2. Listed count: The number of public lists that a user is a part of
    3. Verified: Indicates if a user has been verified by Twitter
    4. Account age: The age of an account in years
    5. Statuses count: The number of statuses posted by the user
    6. Followers to friends ratio: The number of followers to friends for a Twitter user

* **Tweet Parameters:**

The Twitter API enables us to gather 42 parameters for a tweet. However, all parameters cannot be used for classification of tweets into categories as:
   * The classes may be imbalanced or
   * The parameters may not give any information
   
Therefore, we selected features based on past papers and our experience on Twitter as users:

    1. Tweet_ID: Identifier of the tweet (represented as T_ID)
    2. URL_Linked: Indicates if a tweet contains a hyperlink or not
    3. RT: Indicates if a user is choosing to retweet someone elseâ€™s tweet and quoting it
    4. Number of words in the tweet
    5. Number of hashtags in the tweet
    6. Number of characters
    7. Comma which states if a tweet contains a comma or not
    8. Exclamation which states if a tweet contains an exclamation mark or not
    9. Mentions which indicates if that tweet contains a reference to another twitter user
